        <h3>What is Web Framework?</h3>
        <p>
            A <strong>web framework</strong> is a tool that helps developers build websites and web applications faster and more efficiently. 
            It provides pre-built code, templates, and libraries to handle common tasks like routing, database management, 
            and user authentication.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Instead of starting from scratch, developers use frameworks to save time and focus on creating features. Popular examples include 
            Django for Python, Laravel for PHP, and React for JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>web frameworks simplify web development by doing the heavy lifting, so you can focus on what makes your project unique.</p>
        
        <h3>History of Web Framework</h3>
        <p>
            The early World Wide Web was static, with hand-coded HTML files requiring manual updates. In 1993, the <strong>Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</strong>
            allowed web pages to become dynamic by interacting with external applications, though early implementations caused high server load. 
            Later improvements reduced resource usage and improved performance.
        </p>

        <p>
            By 1995, <strong>server-side languages</strong> like <strong>ColdFusion, PHP, and Active Server Pages (ASP)</strong> were introduced, enabling more advanced web development. These 
            languages provided built-in tools but still required additional libraries for specific tasks, such as generating HTML.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the late 1990s, <strong>full-stack web frameworks</strong> emerged, combining multiple libraries into a single development environment. These frameworks streamlined web development by integrating 
            essential tools, improving efficiency, and reducing the complexity of building dynamic web applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Web Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Web frameworks are generally divided into two categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <Strong>Front-End Frameworks:</Strong>Focus on building the user interface (UI) of the application. These frameworks enhance 
                the visual and interactive parts of the web application. 
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><Strong>React</Strong></li>
                    <li><Strong>Vues.js</Strong></li>
                    <li><Strong>Angular</Strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <strong>Back-End Frameworks:</strong> Handle the server-side logic, database management, and other back-end processes.
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><Strong>Django</Strong> (Python)</li>
                    <li><Strong>Laravel</Strong> (PHP)</li>
                    <li><Strong>Express.js</Strong> (Node.js)</li>
                    <li><Strong>Ruby on Rails</Strong> (Ruby)</li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>Capabilities and Trade-offs in Modern Frameworks</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript-based frameworks like React and Vue enhance developer productivity by providing features such as routing, component-based development, and state 
            management. Despite advancements in native web technologies (e.g., Web Components, Fetch API, Shadow DOM), frameworks remain popular due to their ability to 
            handle edge cases, structure large applications, and optimize performance. However, they may introduce complexity, performance overhead, and larger bundle sizes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Modern frameworks like React 18 and Vue 3 address these challenges through features like concurrent rendering and tree-shaking. Lightweight alternatives like 
            Svelte and Preact take unique approaches, such as compiling components to efficient code or offering minimal abstractions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Newer frameworks like Astro, Fresh, and Enhance.dev focus on native web standards, server-side rendering, and progressive enhancement. They minimize client-side 
            JavaScript usage, optimizing performance for content-driven applications while still allowing interactivity when needed.
